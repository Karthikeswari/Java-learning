In this project I am using 1.MAVEN.(Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation)
                           2.PostgerSQL(is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.)
                           3.IDE - Eclipse
